üåê Diving into AWS VPC - Hands-on Lab Experience! üöÄ

Today, I explored Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and gained hands-on experience with key components like:

Subnets üõ†Ô∏è: Isolating resources within different network segments.

Internet Gateway (IGW) üåç: Enabling access to and from the internet.

NAT Gateway üîÑ: Providing internet access for private instances while keeping them secure.

Network Access Control Lists (NACL) üîê: Layered network security for controlling inbound/outbound traffic.

Security Groups (SG) üõ°Ô∏è: Instance-level security with customizable rules.

It was an insightful journey understanding how these components work together to provide robust networking solutions on the cloud!

VPC Creation and Configuration
1. Creating a VPC
In the lab, I started by creating a VPC with an IPv4 CIDR block, which defines the range of IP addresses available within the VPC.

2. Subnets: Public and Private
I then created both public and private subnets within the VPC. Public subnets allow instances to communicate with the internet (via IGW), while private subnets are isolated.

Public Subnet: Used to host instances that need to communicate externally.
Private Subnet: Used for instances requiring a more secure, internal network only.

3. Attaching an Internet Gateway (IGW)
An Internet Gateway was attached to the VPC, allowing instances in the public subnet to communicate with the internet. The IGW serves as a bridge between the VPC and the internet.

4. In AWS, the Routing Table is crucial for directing network traffic within a VPC. A routing table contains a set of rules, known as routes, that determine where network traffic is directed.

Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a routing table, which will define how traffic can flow between your subnets and external networks like the internet or other VPCs.

Key Points:
Local Route: Every VPC comes with a default route that allows communication within the VPC between subnets.
Internet Access: For public subnets to communicate with the internet, the routing table must include a route pointing to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
NAT Gateway Route: To allow private subnets access to the internet (without being exposed), a route directing outbound traffic to the NAT Gateway is necessary.
Example of a Route:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (Any IP address)
Target: igw-xxxxxxxx (Internet Gateway)
By setting up proper routes, I ensured that instances in public subnets could communicate with the internet, while private instances could do so through the NAT Gateway.

5.Creating EC2 instance inside public subnet 1 and getting access to it and running a web server on port 8000:

6. Configuring Security Groups (SG)
Finally, I configured Security Groups, which act as firewalls at the instance level. They control the inbound and outbound traffic for individual instances. I defined specific rules to only allow traffic from trusted sources.

*Unable to acces webserver running on port 8000:

*Got access from Internet:

![20 got access](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/680a9df8-c110-4aa3-b972-908bbf6dcaae)


7. Configuring Network Access Control Lists (NACL)
I set up NACLs to define traffic rules at the subnet level. This ensures an additional layer of security by controlling which IP addresses can communicate with resources in specific subnets.

Inbound Rules: Control the allowed traffic coming into the subnet.
Outbound Rules: Manage the traffic leaving the subnet.
*Configuring "Deny" rule in NACL level (eventhough port 8000 is allowed in SG-level it should block access to webserver)

*Playing with rule numbers(In NACL rules with least number will be given prefrence, changing the above created rule number to 110, so that the rule will number 100 will take precedence):
