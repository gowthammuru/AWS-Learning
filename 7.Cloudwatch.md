I had an exciting hands-on session with AWS CloudWatch today. Here's what I accomplished:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Configured Default CPU Utilization Metric
Set up an EC2 instance and enabled the default CPU Utilization metric in AWS CloudWatch to monitor the instance's performance in real time. üìä

*Created a EC2 instance and got access to it:

![2 got access to ec2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ed409b-70df-41a5-ad67-40094c4f79c6)

*Enabled Detailed monitoring, so that EC2 instance can send the metrics to Cloud watch for every one minute:

2Ô∏è‚É£ Spiked CPU Usage for Testing
Used tools to simulate high CPU usage on the EC2 instance. This helped me observe how CloudWatch captures and displays the metric variations. üìà

*Spiked cpu:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up an Alarm
Configured a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor the CPU utilization. The alarm was set to trigger if the usage exceeded 50%.
Integrated the alarm with Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send an email notification in case the threshold was breached. üì¨
*Configuring Alaram:

*Creating SNS:

*Configuring Mail alert:

![11 done](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/410c962a-84dd-4d0e-b6ff-68a9ee6e1d75)

*Received subscription conformation mail and accepted it:

![13 subscription added](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6816500-714a-4c08-9d17-55811a22683b)

Again Spiked the CPU, which triggered the alarm, and as a result got the notification mail:

Key Takeaways:
Learned how to use CloudWatch to monitor and analyze system metrics effectively.
Got hands-on experience with configuring alarms and integrating them with SNS for real-time alerts.
Understood the importance of proactive monitoring to ensure system reliability and performance.
