AWS VPC Setup with Bastion Host, Auto Scaling Group, Python HTTP Server, and Load Balancer:
POC Setup:
![1 arch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36292fc2-0207-4f01-bc0d-b61c0765ed61)

In this project, I created an AWS infrastructure that included a VPC, a bastion server, an Auto Scaling Group with a launch template, EC2 instances running a Python HTTP server, and a load balancer to manage traffic between the instances.

Key Steps:
Create a VPC with "VPC and More"
Launch a Bastion Server
Access the Bastion Server
Set Up Auto Scaling Group and Launch Template
Deploy EC2 Instances and Run a Python HTTP Server
Create a Load Balancer
Test Load Balancer Functionality
1. Create a VPC with "VPC and More"
I used the "VPC and More" wizard to quickly create a VPC with default settings, including public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and route tables. This set up the network environment for the upcoming resources.

2. Launch a Bastion Server
Next, I launched an EC2 instance in the public subnet to serve as the bastion host. This server provides secure access to other resources in the private subnet.

AMI: Ubuntu 20.04
Instance Type: t2.micro
Security Group: Allowed SSH access from my IP.

3. Set Up Auto Scaling Group and Launch Template
I created a Launch Template that specified the configuration for the EC2 instances that would be created by the Auto Scaling Group.

AMI: Ubuntu 20.04
Instance Type: t2.micro
User Data: Included a basic script to install Python and set up the HTTP server.
I then created an Auto Scaling Group and linked it to the launch template, setting the minimum and maximum number of instances to 2.

4. Access the Bastion Server
After the bastion server was launched, I accessed it via SSH using the key pair. This provided me with access to the private instances that would be created later.

SSH command to access the bastion host:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i <key-pair.pem> ubuntu@<bastion-public-ip>

5. Deploy EC2 Instances and Run Python HTTP Server
The Auto Scaling Group launched two EC2 instances in the private subnet. I accessed these instances through the bastion host and ran a simple HTTP server using Python.

Commands used to install Python3 and run the HTTP server:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 -y
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello from EC2 Instance 1</h1></body></html>" > index.html
python3 -m http.server 80

6. Create a Load Balancer
I created an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across the two EC2 instances. The load balancer was configured to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 and forward it to the instances.

Target Group: Mapped the two EC2 instances created by the Auto Scaling Group.
Listener: Configured to forward HTTP requests.

7. Test Load Balancer Functionality
I tested the load balancer by accessing its DNS name in a web browser. The load balancer distributed the traffic between the two EC2 instances running the Python HTTP server, alternating responses from both instances.

Conclusion
This project set up a fully functional AWS infrastructure with VPC, bastion host, auto-scaling, and load balancing. The two EC2 instances were auto-scaled and mapped to a load balancer, with Python HTTP servers handling the traffic. Below are the screenshots showing each step.
