AWS S3 Bucket: Concepts and Practical Steps
Today, I explored Amazon S3 and learned various important concepts, including bucket name uniqueness across all AWS accounts, bucket versioning, and static website hosting. As a practical exercise, I uploaded an HTML file to a bucket, enabled static website hosting, added the necessary policies to allow access from the internet, and tested the hosted content. Below is the detailed process with screenshots.

1. S3 Bucket Creation and Unique Bucket Name
The first thing I learned is that S3 bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts. This ensures that no two users can create a bucket with the same name anywhere in AWS.

2. Enabling Bucket Versioning
S3 supports versioning, which allows multiple versions of the same object to be stored in a bucket. This is useful for maintaining object history and protecting against accidental deletion or overwriting.

Steps to enable versioning:
Navigate to the Properties tab of the S3 bucket.
Scroll down to the Bucket Versioning section and click Enable.


3. Uploading an HTML File to S3 Bucket
As part of my hands-on exercise, I uploaded an HTML file from my desktop into the S3 bucket, which would be used for static website hosting.

Steps:
Click on Upload and select the HTML file from my local system.
Once uploaded, the file appeared in the bucket’s Objects section.

4. Enabling Static Website Hosting
S3 allows for static website hosting, which can be used to serve static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the bucket. After uploading my HTML file, I enabled static website hosting.

Steps:
Go to the Properties tab of the bucket.
Scroll down to Static website hosting and select Enable.
Specify the index document (e.g., index.html).

5. Adding Bucket Policy for Public Access
To make the HTML file accessible from the internet, I added a bucket policy allowing public read access. This policy allowed anyone with the bucket’s URL to access the content.
Steps:
Go to the Permissions tab and click Bucket Policy.
Add the following JSON to allow public read access:
json
Copy code
'''
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
    }
  ]
}
'''
Replace <bucket-name> with the actual name of the bucket.

7. Testing Static Website Hosting
Once the static website hosting was enabled and the policy was set, I tested accessing the HTML content via the internet. By navigating to the bucket’s website endpoint URL, I could view the HTML file I uploaded.

Steps:
Visit the URL provided in the Static Website Hosting section.
The HTML page was successfully rendered in the browser.

Conclusion
In this exercise, I learned key concepts about Amazon S3, including the need for unique bucket names, versioning support, and static website hosting. By uploading an HTML file and making it publicly accessible, I gained practical knowledge of how to use S3 for hosting static content. Screenshots of each step further illustrate the process.
