# AWS EC2 Learning - Key Pair, Ubuntu Instance, and Jenkins Setup

Today, I continued my AWS learning journey with a focus on **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**. Below are the steps I followed to create a key pair, launch an EC2 instance, and install Jenkins on it.

## üéØ Overview of EC2

Amazon EC2 allows users to rent virtual machines to run applications on AWS infrastructure. People move to EC2 instances because of:
- **Scalability**: Instances can scale up or down based on demand.
- **Cost-efficiency**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Flexibility**: Various instance types to choose from for different workloads.

## 1. Creating a Key Pair

Before launching an EC2 instance, I needed to create a **Key Pair** to securely access the instance using SSH.

### Steps:
- Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** > **Key Pairs**.
- Click on **Create Key Pair** and save the `.pem` file locally (this file is essential for SSH access).

## 2. Launching an Ubuntu Free Tier EC2 Instance

I created a free-tier eligible **Ubuntu** EC2 instance.

### Steps:
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** and click **Launch Instance**.
2. Select the **Ubuntu** AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
3. Choose the **t2.micro** instance type (free tier eligible).
4. Attach the previously created **Key Pair** for secure access.
5. Configure the instance‚Äôs security group to allow **SSH (port 22)** and **HTTP (port 80)** for web traffic.

## 3. Accessing the EC2 Instance via PuTTY

After launching the instance, I used **PuTTY** to access the instance from my local machine.

### Steps:
1. Convert the `.pem` key file to `.ppk` format using **PuTTYgen**.
2. Open **PuTTY** and enter the EC2 instance‚Äôs public IP.
3. Under **SSH > Auth**, browse and select the `.ppk` file for authentication.
4. Click **Open** to establish the SSH connection.

## 4. Installing Java and Jenkins on the Ubuntu EC2 Instance

Once inside the instance, I installed **Java** and **Jenkins**.

### Commands:
```bash
# Update the package list
sudo apt update

# Install Java
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# Add Jenkins repository and install Jenkins
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y

# Start and enable Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```
I tried to access jenkins installed in this ec2 machine from Internet using it's public IP and port 8080, but unable to access it becasue of default security policies in  AWS:

5. Creating a Security Group Policy for Jenkins Access
To access Jenkins from the browser, I created a security policy to allow traffic on port 8080.

Steps:
Go to EC2 Dashboard > Security Groups.
Edit the security group associated with the EC2 instance.
Add an inbound rule allowing traffic on port 8080 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

6. Accessing Jenkins in the Browser
Once the security group was configured, I accessed Jenkins using the EC2 instance's public IP and port 8080 in my browser:

üìù Conclusion
EC2 offers a flexible and scalable platform for running applications in the cloud.
Jenkins was successfully installed and accessed through the EC2 instance, with appropriate security configurations.
Security Groups play a critical role in managing access to EC2 instances.
