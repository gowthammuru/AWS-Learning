1. Installing AWS CLI
To start working with AWS services from the terminal, I installed the AWS CLI on my system.

Steps for installation:
Download the AWS CLI installer from the official documentation.
Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

For Windows:

Download the .msi installer and follow the installation steps.

2. Authenticating AWS CLI with My AWS Account
After installing the AWS CLI, I configured it to interact with my AWS account by providing the necessary credentials.

Steps for authentication:
Run the following command to configure the CLI:
bash
Copy code
aws configure
Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format when prompted.
If you are using MFA, you may need to generate temporary security tokens using AWS STS:

bash
Copy code
aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn-of-mfa-device --token-code code-from-auth-app

3. Creating Two EC2 Instances Using AWS CLI
With the AWS CLI configured, I created two EC2 instances using a single CLI command.

Command to create two EC2 instances:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0123456789abcdef0 \
    --count 2 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name MyKeyPair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0bb1c79de3EXAMPLE \
    --security-group-ids sg-903004f8 \
    --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=MyEC2Instance}]'
Explanation:

--image-id: Specifies the AMI to use.
--count 2: Creates 2 instances.
--instance-type: Specifies the instance type.
--key-name: Key pair for SSH access.
--subnet-id: Subnet in which to launch the instances.
--security-group-ids: Specifies the security group.

4. Listing All Available EC2 Instances
After creating the EC2 instances, I used the following AWS CLI command to list all instances in my AWS account:

Command to list EC2 instances:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, State.Name]' --output table
This command provides a clean table with the instance IDs and their current states.

Conclusion
Through this exercise, I learned how to install, authenticate, and perform basic AWS EC2 management using AWS CLI. The ability to interact with AWS services directly from the terminal is powerful, and AWS CLI provides an efficient way to manage resources at scale.
